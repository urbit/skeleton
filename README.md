# skeleton
a boilerplate for building Urbit app

## Using
```git clone git@github.com:urbit/skeleton.git <your-app-name>```
```git remote set-url origin git@github.com:urbit/<your-app-name>.git```
```git push origin master```

### Choosing app type
The generic boilerplate is `full-app`. If your want to build a subordinate app, you'll use `tile-app`.
Both contain their respective dependencies. All you need to do is `npm install`
